Setting up files to automate my custom settings.

#Install.sh script#
This script runs the whole configuration I need in a new machine to start working
right away. If you want to use it, feel free to do so, but DO IT UNDER YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY!

Please be sure that you need the whole configuration that the script is providing you,
or just use it as an example to automate your own process!

The script has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04 and Fedora 25. (which are the OS I'm using currently)

#"It ain't working!"#
    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It works on my machine!

However please feel free to report any problems or suggest improvements!
